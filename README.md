Portfolio Project to predict the selling price of sold cars

### Problem Statement
The CarDekho company maintains a database of the cars sold through their platform. The data represents the cars sold by Car Dekho and the car related features. We have to build a linear regression model to predict the Selling price of the car. Calculate all the error metrics and diagnostic plots to check the regression result. The dataset contains data for around 301 cars sold by CarDekho.

### Data Description

The general data file contains 301 rows and  columns namely 1)Car_Name 2)Year	3)Selling_Price	4)Present_Price	5)Kms_Driven 6)Fuel_Type 7)Seller_Type 8)Transmission	Owner

Car_Name: Name of the cars. Year: Year of the car when it was bought. Selling_Price: Price at which the car is being sold. Present_Price: Current ex-showroom price of the car. Kms_Driven: Distance completed by the car in km. Fuel_Type: Fuel type of the car. Seller_Type: Tells if a Seller is Individual or a Dealer. Transmission: Gear transmission of the car (Automatic/Manual). Owner: Number of previous owners of the car.

### Purpose of solving the problem

Predicting the selling price of cars for a company like CarDekho can serve multiple purposes, enabling both operational efficiency and strategic business decisions. Here's why it would be valuable:

#### 1. Enhanced Pricing Strategy
Accurate Pricing Recommendations: Predicting the selling price allows CarDekho to recommend fair and competitive prices for buyers and sellers based on historical data, ensuring a better match between demand and supply.
Dynamic Pricing: The model can adjust pricing based on market trends, seasonal demand, or other external factors to maximize revenue.

#### 2. Improved Customer Experience
Transparency: Providing sellers with a realistic price range builds trust and confidence in the platform.
Time Savings: Buyers can filter cars within a specific price range, and sellers can set prices aligned with market expectations, reducing negotiation time.

#### 3. Operational Efficiency
Automation: Automating price estimation saves time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual assessment.
Fraud Prevention: Detecting anomalies in pricing can help flag potentially fraudulent listings or incorrect valuations.

#### 4. Market Analysis and Insights
Trend Analysis: The predictions can provide insights into market trends, such as the most popular car models, price depreciation patterns, and demand dynamics.
Inventory Management: For dealerships or sellers holding stock, predictive pricing can assist in inventory turnover by identifying optimal selling prices.

#### 5. Revenue Optimization
Maximizing Sales: Predicting the right selling price increases the likelihood of transactions, leading to higher platform usage and revenue from transaction fees.
Upselling Opportunities: The model can identify higher-value cars or add-ons to offer targeted promotions or bundles.

#### 6. Business Expansion
Personalized Services: With accurate predictions, CarDekho can offer personalized services such as trade-in offers, financing options, and insurance plans tailored to the predicted value of a car.
Partnership Leverage: Insights from pricing predictions can be shared with OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and dealers to strengthen partnerships.

#### 7. Training and Innovation
Data-Driven Learning: The system serves as a feedback loop to improve future predictions and enhance machine learning models.
Product Development: Analyzing prediction performance can inspire new features or tools on the platform, such as resale value calculators or market trend dashboards.

By integrating predictive pricing models, CarDekho can strengthen its position in the automotive market, build trust among its users, and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.
